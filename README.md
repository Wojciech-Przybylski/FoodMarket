# About
This is a web application built on the **Django framework**, following the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture pattern. The application provides functionalities to allow users to register and log in to their unique accounts, add groceries to their basket, and place orders. The application utilizes **SQLite** as its database system, which is seamlessly integrated with Django.

Upon successful registration and login, registered users can access their personal accounts, where they can add items to their basket, view their basket, place orders, and access their order history.

The application features a shop page where users can browse and select desired groceries to add to their basket. By selecting the quantity of each product and clicking the "Add to Basket" button, the selected groceries are added to the user's basket.

The basket page allows users to view all the items they have added to their basket, along with their quantity, price per unit, and total price.

Additionally, users can view their order history to access information such as the date/time of the order, the items purchased along with their quantities and prices, and the total cost of the order.
